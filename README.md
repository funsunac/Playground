# MAD Group Project #

This is the working repository for MAD 2017-18 Semester 2 Group Projec 1G1.
The document here is copied from last semester OOP project, please correct me if there are any problems.

### How do I get set up? ###

The project work best with the Android Studio environment. To import the project in Android Studio:

1. Check out project from Version Control
2. Choose GitHub
3. Login GitHub
4. Select this repository `g1-extrateamlab`
5. Click clone!
6. Open the project
7. Tools -> Android -> Sync with Gradle Files

### Contribution guidelines ###

The project would not be successful without your contribution! Follow the steps to create a new feature:

1. VCS -> Git -> Branches
2. New Branch
3. Name your branch as `feature/yourfeaturename`
4. Make awesome changes to the code!
5. Commit your changes using VCS -> Update Project, remember to stage your changes and make a nice commit message

Before submitting, you should clean up your work:

1. Switch to `master` branch, do a pull to update latest changes
2. Switch back to `feature/yourfeaturename`, run a rebase with master
3. Resolve conflicts if needed, seek help if you don't know how to do so

Lastly push the branch to GitHub and create a PR:

1. Team -> Push Branch `feature/yourfeaturename`
2. Go to GitHub and create a pull request
3. Set the source as `feature/yourfeaturename` and merge into `master`
4. Wait for approval!

It is good to spend some time familarizing yourself with git. You will face it anyway in future software engineering courses. :P
